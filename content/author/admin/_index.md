I am a researcher and lecturer in spatial cognition. I am a neuroscienctist by training and I apply psychological methods in the fields of geoinformatics and human-computer interaction. 
I am also a science slammer and regularly on stage, as I am interested in communicating research, its results and implications to a broad audience.
