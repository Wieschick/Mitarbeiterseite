abstract = "We study the role of place and region names in the formation of spatial hierarchies. Representations were probed behaviorally, i.e., by choices between two equidistant routes differing only in the number of regions they touched. Routes crossing fewer region boundaries are preferred over routes crossing more region boundaries. Visual landmark objects from a common semantic category placed in spatial vicinity induce region representations. Here we show that region dependent route preference is reduced if the landmark objects are replaced by signs displaying object names. The effects of explicit region names and linguistic properties of different naming schemes are discussed."

abstract = "Sleep is thought to preferentially consolidate hippocampus-dependent memory, and as such, spatial navigation. Here, we investigated the effects of sleep on route knowledge and explicit and implicit semantic regions in a virtual environment. Sleep, compared with wakefulness, improved route knowledge and also enhanced awareness of the semantic regionalization within the environment, whereas signs of implicit regionalization remained unchanged. Results support the view that sleep specifically enhances explicit aspects of memory, also in the spatial domain. Enhanced region knowledge after sleep suggests that consolidation during sleep goes along with the formation of more abstract schema-like representations."
